## Shout Out

Thank you to Gien, Riccardo, and Mathias for making Open F# happen again!

***

### Scenario

* Create a library that handles communication with an internal service that will be used by many other services
* Will be used by every microservice
* We're going to write it in F# to level up our skills!
* For fun we'll demo this with an internal "Pokemon" service

---

### Simple Requirements

Abstract REST API into domain specific methods

Expose C# Friendly Interface

---

### The Contract

```csharp
public interface IPokemonAdapter
{
    Task<Result<IEnumerable<Card>>,string>> GetCards(string name);
}
```
*For the sake of simplicity we'll just return an F# result. In practice this would be mapped to [CSharpFunctionalExtensions](https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions) `Result`*

***

### F# Asynchronous Programming

1. Google "F# async await"
  <img style="border: none; box-shadow: none" src="images/async-vs-task/fsharp-async-await.png" alt="F# Async Await" />

2. Read about Async Workflows

---

### Async

```fsharp
type Foo = {
    Name: string
}

// string -> Async<Foo>
let getFoo n = async {
    do! Async.Sleep 100
    return { Name = n }
}

// Async<Foo>
let jFoo = getFoo "J"

// get Foo out
jFoo |> Async.RunSynchronously |> printfn "%A"
```

---

### Async <> Task

*How do I get a task instead?*

```fsharp
type Foo = {
    Name: string
}

// string -> Async<Foo>
let getFoo n = async {
    printfn "Begin async workflow"
    // Pretend this is waiting on some other async operation
    do! Async.Sleep 100
    return { Name = n }
}

// Task<Foo>
let jFoo = (getFoo "J") |> Async.StartAsTask

// Ideally don't use .Result.
jFoo.Result |> printfn "%A"
```

---

### Await a Task

```fsharp
type Foo = {
    Name: string
}

// string -> Task<Foo>
let fooTask n = Task.FromResult({ Name = n })

// string -> Task<Foo>
let getFoo n =
    async {
        printfn "Begin async workflow"
        do! Async.Sleep 100
        // await task and map to async
        let! f = fooTask n |> Async.AwaitTask
        return f
    } |> Async.StartAsTask
```

***

### Implement It

*Now that we know how to go from Async to Task and back...*

---

### Follow the F# Style Guide

[Do your best to follow the F# Component Design Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/style-guide/component-design-guidelines)

---

### Make Use of Object Programming

```fsharp
type PokemonAdapter() =
    let httpClient = new HttpClient()
    interface IPokemonAdapter with
        member __.GetCards(name: string) =
            async {
                let! cardsString =
                getPokemonFromSource httpClient contents
                |> Async.AwaitTask
                let cards =
                    pokemonToDto cardsString
                    |> getCardsByName name
                return cards
            } |> Async.StartAsTask

    interface IDisposable with
        member __.Dispose() = httpClient.Dispose()
```

### Wire it Up

Simple .NET Core Web API

[Code Time](https://github.com/jeremyabbott/WebPerfTest/tree/master/WebPerfApi)

***

### Load Test It

1. Setup shared service and consuming service with adapter in docker containers
2. Warm up application
3. Run load tests

---

### Load Test Benchmarks

1. Setup route on service that does the same work without the adapter (**This is the baseline**)
2. Setup route on service that uses our adapter
3. Tests must be reproducible

---

### Test Setup

Load tests run with [vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)

<img style="border: none; box-shadow: none" src="images/async-vs-task/TestRunner.png" alt="bash snippet of load test runner" />

---

### Test Conditions

In the production scenario we deployed to production like servers instead of docker containers.

Docker was used here to provide some constraints on the resources since a 2018 MBP <> Prod Web Servers

### Test Findings Must be Reproducible

1. We could reliably reproduce the "bad" tests
1. But I can't reproduce it now
1. Both scenarios are ASP .NET Core 2.0
1. Only appreciable differnce is OS and "fake shared service"
1. Real shared service is MUCH more optimized
1. Kestrel is super performant

---

### What We Thought Was Happening

1. There's a cost from converting from Async to Task
1. There's a cost from awaiting a task to an Async
1. These are primarily IO bound operations
1. However, at scale* every ms that we have to wait for a thread in the thread pool to be available is too long.
1. These requests begin to pile up

---

### Still True

1. There's a cost from converting from Async to Task
1. There's a cost from converting a Task to an Async
1. These are primarily IO bound operations
1. Kestrel is super performant

---

### Let's Finish the Story...

***

### Pre-Optimizations Are Not Efficient

1. Development Time is expensive
1. Having a test-driven culture is less-expensive
1. Have a realistic goal and test it based on known business requirements
1. Optimize accordingly

***

### How Did We "Fix" It?

#### TaskBuilder to the Rescue

```fsharp
let getPokemonFromSourceAsTask (httpClient: HttpClient) url name =
    task {
        try
            let url = sprintf "%s/cards/%s" url name
            let! response = httpClient.GetStringAsync(url)
            return response |> Ok
        with ex ->
            // PLEASE üôè don't do this for real
            let message =
                sprintf
                    "Failed to retrieve cards with error: %s"
                    ex.Message
            return Error message
    }
```

### Takeways

1. Async is an awesome programming model
  * It's great for IO bound tasks
1. Async to Task is usually fine
1. If you're working with a lot of Task based APIs, consider going Task all the way
1. If you're exposing an API for C#, consider going Task all the way
1. Be Mindful of Your Test Tools
